# Binary Tree Chat Visualization

This project implements a Binary Tree data structure to visualize chat messages. Each message is represented as a node in the tree, allowing for operations like insertion, deletion, and editing. The visualization includes sender avatars, timestamps, and a dynamic SVG-based tree display.

## Features

- Message Management: Insert, delete, and edit chat messages.
- Interactive Visualization: Dynamic SVG tree representation of message structure.
- User Interface: Sender avatars, timestamps, and intuitive message display.

## Usage

1. Add Messages: Enter sender name and message, then click "Send Message".
2. Edit/Delete: Hover over messages to edit or delete.
3. Visualization: View the binary tree structure below the message box.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Binary-Tree-Chat-Message-Visualization.git
